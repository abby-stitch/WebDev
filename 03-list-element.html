    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves (crushed)</li>
    <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger (grated)</li>
    <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
    <li>boneless and skinless</li>
    <li>3 tbsp medium spice paste (tikka works well)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<h3>Step1</h3>
<p>Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt and fry for 8-10 mins, or until the onion has turned golden brown and sticky. Add the garlic and ginger, cooking for a further minute.</p>
<h3>Step2</h3>
    <p>Chop the chicken into chunky 3cm pieces, add to the pan and fry for 5 mins before stirring through the spice paste and tomatoes, along with 250ml water. Bring to the boil, lower to a simmer and cook on a gentle heat uncovered for 25-30 mins or until rich and slightly reduced. Stir though the yogurt, coriander and ground almonds, season and serve with warm naan or fluffy basmati rice.</p>
<h2>How to thicken curry sauce</h2>
    <p>If you find your sauce is on the runny side, there are several ways to fix this. Here are our top 3 methods:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Simmering gently on a low temperature will reduce the volume of liquid as well as intensifying the flavour of the curry.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tbsp cornflour to 2-3 tbsp of cold water to form a slurry. Then add this to the curry and simmer until it thickens.</li>
    <li>Add a few tbsp of Greek yogurt, which will give the curry a lovely creamy consistency too.</li>
